\section{Background}\label{chick-background}

Programs are rarely written once and for all: bugs may be found that must be
fixed, requirements may evolve in ways that require rewriting parts of a
program, and programs may be re-written in semantically-equivalent ways in order
to account for performance, resource-efficiency, or even simply stylistic
concerns.

The concept of \define{refactoring}, which was introduced as early as
in~\citet{wirfs1990surveying}, characterizes program transformations that
preserve the semantics of the program being manipulated.
