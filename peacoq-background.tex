\section{Background}

Proof assistants have a steep learning curve.  Not only do they require an
understanding of high-level mathematical concepts, including but extending
beyond the ones presented in Chapter~\ref{background}, but they also require the
user to learn the idiosyncrasies of their proof assistant of choice.  Even
experts of a given proof assistant would require at least several days to
become comfortable in a new proof assistant.

% TODO

We have identified three challenges in the learning process for novice users
that we would like to tackle with \PeaCoq{}:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item conceptualizing and keeping track of the \emph{proof tree structure}
while building proofs,

  \item identifying the effects of a tactic on the proof context,

  \item identifying relevant tactics that can be applied in a given proof
obligation.

\end{enumerate}
