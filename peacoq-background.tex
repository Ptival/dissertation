\section{Background}

% TODO

We have identified three challenges in the learning process for novice users
that we would like to tackle with \PeaCoq{}:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item conceptualizing and keeping track of the \emph{proof tree structure}
while building proofs,

  \item identifying the effects of a tactic on the proof context,

  \item identifying relevant tactics that can be applied in a given proof
obligation.

\end{enumerate}
