\chapter{\Coop{}: extending \Chick{} to repair other languages}

In this chapter, we present ongoing work to extend \Chick{} so that it can
repair programs regardless of their surface level language.  We call this
extension \Coop{}.

Section~\ref{coop-design} presents a high-level view of the architecture of
\Coop{}.

Section~\ref{coop-embedding-extracting} explains how we embed constructs from
foreign languages within \Chick{}, and how we extract those back after repair.

Section~\ref{coop-optics} describes our use of traversals to repair inner
constructs that we handle within outer constructs that we do not handle.

Section~\ref{coop-diff-pretty-printer} shows how we can turn the output abstract
syntax tree of \Coop{} into concrete syntax with minimal impact on the original
layout of the code.
