This thesis aims to design and evaluate novel tools for helping users of
functional programming languages and proof assistants.

Over the past couple decades, the concept of \emph{functional programming} has
flourished from an academic object of interest to a trending topic in both
academia and industry.  Concepts that used to be mostly relevant in the context
of functional programming languages, for instance, \emph{anonymous functions},
\emph{currying}, \emph{monads}, or \emph{dependent types}, are percolating into
many functional languages as well as mainstream imperative languages.
