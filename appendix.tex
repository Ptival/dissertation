\chapter{\PeaCoq{} A-B study post-study survey}~\label{appendix-peacoq-a-b-study}

We report the qualitative feedback obtained via a questionnaire given after the
A-B study described in Section~\ref{peacoq-a-b-study}.  We indicate participants
anonymously as $Xp_{i}$ where $X$ stands for the study group ($A$ being the
\define{control group}, $B$ being the group testing our tool), $p$ stands for a
given pair of participants, and $i$ distinguishes between the two participants
in a pair.

We report participants' answers as is: we do fix typos, but do not alter their
phrasing or grammatical structures whatsoever.

  $A1_{1}$ & Proved several theorems in a pair using an interactive proof assistant. \\

  Participant & \multicolumn{1}{c}{
    \textbf{What did the experience today remind you of?}
  } \\ \midrule
  $A1_{1}$ & Learning to program for the first time. Lots of brute-forcing and trying things that worked in the past to see if they would work in a new context. \\
  $A1_{2}$ & Using induction in high school/undergrad and trying to draw insights from proving the base case to apply to the general case. \\
  $A2_{1}$ & Today was quite unique but I felt like writing functional programs since I tried to prove my implementation there too. \\
  $A2_{2}$ & It reminded me of working on large code bases where certain things appear to work by magic.  Fixes/proofs were performed with little fundamental understanding. \\

  Participant & \multicolumn{1}{c}{
    \textbf{Did you understand all the proofs you completed?}
  } \\ \midrule
  $A1_{1}$ & No. \\
  $A1_{2}$ & No.  We figured out that there were some hammers which we should keep using (\coqinlineDEBUG{simpl}, \coqinlineDEBUG{reflexivity}, \coqinlineDEBUG{rewrite}).  They mostly made sense but we didn't spend time to understand the exact changes they made. \\
  $A2_{1}$ & Most of them.  Especially the last ones were quite confusing. \\
  $A2_{2}$ & Not entirely.  While I had conceptual knowledge of what was happening, I didn't understand it holistically. \\

  $A1_{1}$ & Error messages were mostly helpful sometimes. Sort of. Clear when something didn't work. \\
  $A1_{2}$ & Yes.  Because it would stop me from trying to use wrong rules.  Also because I could follow from one lemma to another in most cases. \\
  $A2_{1}$ & \begin{enumerate*} \item Has a simple, clean UI \item Doesn't require anything other than a browser. \end{enumerate*} \\

    \textbf{Do you have suggestions on how to improve the tool you used today?}
  } \\ \midrule
  $A1_{1}$ & Backing up through a \coqinlineDEBUG{Qed.} backs up the entire proof.  Would prefer to step back one tactic at a time like during the proof.  Right-hand pane sometimes not wide enough to see everything.  Primitive sub-string matching to suggest rewrites would be useful. \\
  $A1_{2}$ & \begin{enumerate*} \item It should stop me from going down useless proof steps even though the rules apply. \item It should stop me from going in circles by warning (we are not sure we did that but came close). \item Difficult to translate intuition from base case to general case.  Had to use pen-and-paper at times to write small examples. \end{enumerate*} \\
  $A2_{1}$ & \begin{enumerate*} \item Missing some keyboard shortcuts. \item Having a pane which shows previous proofs would be quite helpful. \end{enumerate*} \\
  $A2_{2}$ & I had little confidence that I understood what was happening.  Completing the same proofs later would likely result in similar trial and error.  The only thing I was learning was the sort of patterns that proofs took on.  Variable names were confusing and hard to work with. \\
