\subsection{Syntax of \Chick{} terms}\label{chick-syntax-terms}

\Chick{} is designed as a small functional programming language upon which the
repair algorithm will operate.  The aim was to represent a language such as
\Gallina{}, and as such, \Chick{} is a dependently-typed lambda calculus, with
inductive constructions.  The syntax of \Chick{} is given in this grammar:

\begin{grammar}%
<term> ::= \ %trick LaTeX
\alt <term> : <term>                                           \hfill (type annotation)
\alt <term> <term>                                             \hfill (application)
\alt _                                                         \hfill (hole)
\alt $\lambda$ <binder>, <term>                                \hfill (value abstraction)
\alt match <term> with $\overrightarrow{ \synt{pattern} }$ end \hfill (pattern matching)
\alt $\Pi$(<binder> : <term>) â†’ <term>                         \hfill (type abstraction)
\alt <universe>                                                \hfill (universes)
\alt <var>                                                     \hfill (variable)

<universe> ::= Prop \alt Set \alt Type

<binder> ::= \ % trick LaTeX
\alt <var> \hfill (named)
\alt _     \hfill (anonymous)

<pattern> ::= ($\overrightarrow{ \synt{binder} }$, <term>)
\end{grammar}

The \emph{application}, \emph{value abstraction}, \emph{type abstraction}, and
\emph{variable} constructs, are standard constructs of a dependently-typed
lambda calculus.

The \emph{type annotation} construct lets us ascribe a type to a given term.
The \emph{hole} construct can take the place of a term anywhere: it stands for a
missing value that should be filled by the programmer.  Together, these two
constructs let us have \define{typed holes}, that is, placeholder values whose
type is known.  This proves invaluable throughout the repair algorithm, as we
will see, since there are situations where the algorithm must come up with
arbitrary values, knowing only the type they should bear.  In the absence of
synthesis techniques to generate such values, the algorithm can safely insert a
typed hole, leaving to the programmer the task of figuring out the proper value.

Finally, the \emph{pattern matching} construct is found in languages with
algebraic data types, and lets us dispatch code based on the shape of some
such data type.

We use the same universe names as found in \Gallina{}, though we do not yet
support its cumulative universe hierarchy syntactically.  However, this does
\emph{not} mean that \Chick{} cannot repair \Gallina{} programs that use the
universe hierarchy, but rather, it cannot syntactically represent universe
levels.  Instead, \Chick{} is oblivious to universe levels, so it will repair
programs regardless of their universe level.  The downside is that it cannot
represent explicit universe levels, and as such, might break programs that
require them.  Universe levels can be added almost for free, since the repair
algorithm could simply carry them along and attempt no repair.

While we use the underscore symbol ($\_$) to represent both a hole term and an
anonymous binder, the two concepts can never appear in the same program
location, and therefore, there can be no confusion: in a term context, the
symbol represents a hole, while in a binding context, it represents an anonymous
binder.
