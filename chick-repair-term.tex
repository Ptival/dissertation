\subsection{Repairing terms} \label{chick-design-repair-term}

The repair algorithm for terms is described formally in
Figures~\ref{fig:repair-term} and~\ref{rules-unknown-repair} using the following
judgments:

{
  \[
    {\turnstile
      { \dcontext{E}{\delta_E}{\Gamma}{\delta_\Gamma} }
      {\repair{t}{\delta_t}{\tau}{\delta_\tau}}
    }
  \]
  % \[
  %   {\turnstile
  %     { \dcontext{E}{\delta_E}{\Gamma}{\delta_\Gamma} }
  %     {\genericrepair{t}{\delta_t}{\tau}}
  %   }
  % \]
  \[
    {\turnstile
      { \dcontext{E}{\delta_E}{\Gamma}{\delta_\Gamma} }
      {\repairTermWithoutType{t}{\delta_t}}
    }
  \]
}%
%
The first judgment (Figure~\ref{fig:repair-term}) describes how a term is
repaired when we know both its old type $\tau$, and how that type got modified
$\delta_\tau$.  It is syntax-directed by the structure of $\delta_\tau$.  The
second judgment (Figure~\ref{rules-unknown-repair}) describes how a term is
repaired when we no longer make decisions based on its old type and type diff:
this happens for constructs whose type does not inform us about the type of its
constituents (for instance, function application), and for simple terms (holes,
universes, variables).

The judgments for repairing terms include a local context $\Gamma$, behaving
similarly to the global environment $E$ but holding local variables introduced
by the binding structures of terms.  The first judgment is therefore to be
understood as: given that a term $t$ had type $\tau$ in the global environment
$E$ and the local context $\Gamma$, if those latter three respectively undergo
the modifications $\delta_\tau$, $\delta_E$, and $\delta_\Gamma$, then the term
$t$ should be repaired according to $\delta_t$.  The other judgment is to be
read similarly, except the type information is missing.  Importantly, the first
judgment assumes the diff $\delta_\tau$ is repaired already: it is the
responsibility of the caller to ensure so.
