\begin{dissertationabstract}

Dependently-typed functional languages are increasingly popular, but due to the
complexity of their type systems, there is still a lot of friction in the user
experience, both for beginners who try to learn the concepts, and expert users
who must write and maintain complex code bases.  We explore ways to alleviate
those burdens by providing novel front-end tooling for this class of languages.

In order to help beginners, we explore new visualizations and automation
techniques, focusing on three pain points we identified in the learning process.
We evaluate, via a longitudinal user study and an A-B study, their effectiveness
in terms of learning to use those languages, enjoyment of the learning process,
and productivity on solving beginner-level exercises.

In order to help experts, we prototype a tool that helps in the refactoring of
programs, partially eliminating the tedium of propagating changes throughout
large code bases.  We evaluate this tool over a choice of refactoring
benchmarks, and show how it can be extended to support other languages than the
toy language we designed it for.  We evaluate one instance of this extension
technique to repair programs in the \OCaml{} language, a functional language
without dependent types, but with more features than our tool was built for.

% The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
% doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
% problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
% generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
% study. The abstract may continue onto a second page if necessary. The
% text of the abstract must be double spaced.

% \verb!\mainmatter! macro because it should start on page~1.
