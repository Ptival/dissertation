\subsection{Repairing programs}~\label{repair-program}

The repair algorithm for programs $\repairProgOp$ is described formally in
Figure~\ref{fig:repair-program} using the following judgment:

{
  \[
    {\turnstile
      {\denv{E}{\delta_E}}
      {\repairProg{p}{\delta_p}{\delta_p'}}
    }
  \]
}

\paragraph{Notation} This judgment can be read as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Top}: If the original program $p$ type-checked in the original environment $E$,
\item \textbf{Bottom left}: and the environment underwent modification $\delta_{E}$,
\item \textbf{Bottom center}: and the program underwent modification $\delta_{p}$,
\item \textbf{Right}: then $\repairProgOp$ proposes to repair the program with modification $\out{\delta'_{p}}$.
\end{itemize}

To be more precise, $E$ is the environment in which the original program $p$ was
defined: a list of term definitions, with type $\GlobalDefinitionText$, and of
inductive data type definitions, with type $\GlobalInductiveText$ (as presented
in Section~\ref{chick-syntax-programs}).  Each vernacular command is
type-checked in such a global typing environment, and upon being executed,
populates it with some additional definitions for the subsequent commands.

$\delta_E$, is a diff indicating how the global environment has been changed by
the time $p$ is reached by the repair algorithm: it accounts for whether some
definitions have been added, removed, or modified, in the prefix of the program
already-repaired preceding $p$.  For instance, in our motivating example, by the
time we reach the inductive definition being modified (\coqinline{list},
becoming \coqinline{vec}), $E$ would contain the inductive data type definition
for the type \coqinline{nat}, and $\delta_E$ would keep it intact.  After this
definition has been processed, $E$ would contain, in order, \coqinline{nat}, and
\coqinline{list}, and $\delta_E$ would still keep the former intact, but would
register the diff turning \coqinline{list} into \coqinline{vec}.

The repair algorithm for programs takes as input the original program $p$, and
the user-provided modification $\delta_p$.  From those, it outputs a repaired
modification $\out{\delta_p'}$, that propagates the changes introduced by
$\delta_E$ and $\delta_p$ to the rest of the program $p$.  The algorithm
essentially folds over the sequence of vernacular commands that make up the
program, propagating changes from previous commands to subsequent ones.

\paragraph{\rulename{\RProgMod}}

\[ \RuleRProgModify{} \]

This rule does the bulk of the work, dispatching the repair of each vernacular
command to the repair algorithm for vernacular commands $\repairVernacOp$
(described in Section~\ref{repair-vernacular}).  First, the head vernacular
command $v$ is repaired (using $\repairVernacOp$), returning a repaired diff
$\out{\delta_v'}$.  Then, we want to repair the rest of the program, but the
changes made to $v$ may affect the global environment for the subsequent
commands.  For instance, in our motivating example, the vernacular command
defining the inductive type \coqinline{list} gets modified to define the
inductive type \coqinline{vec} instead: when we repair the rest of the program,
we must remember that the original program was defined in a global environment
where \coqinline{list} was defined, and that the updated program must replace it
with \coqinline{vec}.  We therefore repair the rest of the program $p$ in the
appropriate updated environment and its diff.

\paragraph{Note} While our presentation makes it look like vernacular commands
each add exactly one element to the global environment, it is not always as
simple: inductive data type definitions add \begin{enumerate*} \item the
inductive type (e.g. \coqinline{list}), \item all its constructors
(e.g. \coqinline{nil}, \coqinline{cons}), \item and all its eliminators
(e.g. \coqinline{list_rec}, \coqinline{list_ind}, as described later in
Section~\ref{deriving}) \end{enumerate*}.  For simplifying diff operations, the
whole $\InductiveText$ effectively acts as a placeholder, in our formalism, for
all of those at once.  The lookup rules, given in Appendix~\ref{appendix-chick},
encapsulate the complexity of accounting for all the definitions arising from
one inductive data type definition.

\rulename{\RProgSameCons} simply defers to \rulename{\RProgMod}: even though it
processes unchanged commands, they might need repairs to account for changes in
upstream, accounted for in the global environment.
