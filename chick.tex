\chapter{Chick: a small language and its program repair algorithm}~\label{chick}

This chapter will focus on the development and evaluation of a tool to help
functional programmers propagate changes made to some of their definitions to
the rest of their code, called \Chick{}\footnotemark{}.
Section~\ref{chick-background} gives additional background specific to this
chapter.  Section~\ref{chick-design} describes the global design of the tool and
its components.  Section~\ref{chick-syntax} will cover the syntax of the
language over which \Chick{} operates.

\footnotetext{All code for \Chick{} is publicly available at:

In Section~\ref{chick-diffs}, we will describe a family of data types that allow
us to perform repairs.  Section~\ref{chick-lookup} will present both usual
lookup rules, and \Chick{}-specific lookup rules, that are necessary to describe
the repair algorithm.  Section~\ref{chick-repair} will then describe the repair
algorithm and all its components.

Section~\ref{chick-deriving} goes into more details into how some diff
operations needed by the repair algorithm can be automatically derived from
small descriptions of their reactions to certain changes in the data structure
they operate on.  Finally, we describe how we automatically infer diffs from
pairs of programs without requiring user help in Section~\ref{chick-guess}.
