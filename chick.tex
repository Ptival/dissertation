\chapter{\Chick{}: a core dependently-typed language and its repair
algorithm}~\label{chick}

This chapter will focus on the development and evaluation of a tool (named
\Chick{}\footnotemark{}) whose purpose is to help functional programmers
propagate changes, made to some of their definitions, to the rest of their code.

\footnotetext{All code for \Chick{} is publicly available at:
\url{https://github.com/Ptival/chick}}

Section~\ref{chick-background} gives background specific to this chapter.

Section~\ref{chick-design} describes the global design of the tool and its
components.

Section~\ref{chick-syntax} covers the syntax of the language over which \Chick{}
operates.

Section~\ref{chick-diffs} describes a family of data types that allow us to
perform repairs.

Section~\ref{chick-lookup} will present both usual lookup rules, and
\Chick{}-specific lookup rules, that are necessary to describe the repair
algorithm.

Section~\ref{chick-repair} describes all the components of the repair algorithm.

Section~\ref{chick-deriving} goes into more details into how some diff
operations needed by the repair algorithm can be automatically derived from
small descriptions of their reactions to certain changes in the data structure
they operate on.

Section~\ref{chick-guess}, finally, describes how we automatically infer diffs
from pairs of programs without requiring additional user input.
